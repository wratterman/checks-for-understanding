#### Review  

10. Why do people say "HTTP is stateless"?
  - Because it doesn't automatically store any data about different user/server transactions
  - The information is lost once the transaction ends
11. Describe a RESTful API.
  - Clientâ€“server: The client handles the front end the server handles the backend and can both be replaced independently of each other.
  - Stateless: No client data is stored on the server between requests and session state is stored on the client.
  - Cacheable: Clients can cache response (just like browsers caching static elements of a web page) to improve performance.
12. What are some main characteristics of a team following an agile workflow?
  - Highly communicative, regular team checkins
  - Team members taking small "stories" to work on
  - Quick "sprint" work schedules, 2-6 weeks per feature
13. What are some advantages **and** disadvantages to using OAuth to authenticate a user?
  - Advantages: 
    - You aren't storing user passwords on your DB. Nothing to hack
    - You get access to the API endpoints of the service that you use for OAuth
      
  - Disadvantages:
    - It is dependent on Users having an account with the OAuth provider
    - You sacrifice control
